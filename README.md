### Introduction
This assignment is part of the Innovation Hacks AI competition. It focuses on the implementation and understanding of the ReSearch Framework, a reinforcement learning-based system designed to integrate search and reasoning. The goal of the assignment is to reproduce baseline experiments, comprehend GRPO (Generalized Reward Prediction Optimization) in practice, and evaluate the performance of search and reasoning integration in the ReSearch framework.

Through this assignment, we aim to dive deep into the mechanisms of reinforcement learning and search optimization, explore reward systems, and analyze the results both qualitatively and quantitatively.
